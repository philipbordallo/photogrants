	"description": "Light Work began offering grants to CNY artists in 1975 to encourage the production of new photographic work in the region. In its 40-year history, Light Work Grants have supported more than 110 artists, some multiple times. With the help of the regional grant, many artists have been able to continue long term projects, purchase equipment, frame photographs for exhibitions, promote their work, collaborate with others or otherwise continue their artist goals.",
